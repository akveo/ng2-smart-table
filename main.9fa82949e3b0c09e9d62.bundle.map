Right, there is no data in the table by default. To add some, let's create an array property with a list of objects in the component. Please note that object keys are same as in the columns configuration.\\n  </p>\\n  <pre>\\n    <code class=\\\"typescript\\\">{{ snippets.array }}</code>\\n  </pre>\\n  <p>And pass the data to the table:</p>\\n  <pre>\\n    <code class=\\\"typescript\\\">{{ snippets.dataTemplate }}</code>\\n  </pre>\\n  <p>Now you have some data in the table:</p>\\n  <div>\\n    <basic-example-data></basic-example-data>\\n  </div>\\n  <p>\\n    That's it for a minimal setup, our final component should look like this, pretty simple, huh?\\n  </p>\\n  <pre class=\\\"with-source\\\">\\n    <a class=\\\"source\\\" href=\\\"https://github.com/akveo/ng2-smart-table/blob/master/demo/src/app/pages/demo/components/basic-example-data.component.ts\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Demo Source</a>\\n    <code class=\\\"typescript\\\">{{ snippets.basicFull }}</code>\\n  </pre>\\n  <h3><a id=\\\"separate-filter\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\" href=\\\"#separate-filter\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"><span aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"octicon octicon-link\\\"></span></a>Standalone Filter Example</h3>\\n  <p>\\n    Say you don't need to have a filter field in the each table column or the requirements says that search field should be placed outside of the table?<br>\\n    Fortunately this is super easy to achieve, to do this we need to slightly modify our basic component example.\\n  </p>\\n  <h4><a id=\\\"data-source\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\" href=\\\"#data-source\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"><span aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"octicon octicon-link\\\"></span></a>Data Source</h4>\\n  <p>\\n    First thing you need to know is that all the data operations against the table <i>must</i> be done using the <strong>DataSource</strong> table property. DataSource is an abstraction around your data which allows you easily modify the table data or subscribe to events to modify the table behaviour. \\n  </p>\\n  <p>\\n    To access the DataSource we either can take it from the table or pass it instead of our <i>data array</i>. Let's do the second option as it requires less code and is more demonstrative. Let's import the DataSource class by modifying the import statement:\\n  </p>\\n  <pre>\\n    <code class=\\\"typescript\\\">{{ snippets.sourceRequire }}</code>\\n  </pre>\\n  <p>\\n    Note that the import now contains a <strong>LocalDataSource</strong> class (the word <i>Local</i> here means that the data is processed locally in a browser, not on the server side).<br>\\n    Then let's create a DataSource instance and pass our data array into it as a constructor parameter:\\n  </p>\\n  <pre>\\n    <code class=\\\"typescript\\\">{{ snippets.createSource }}</code>\\n  </pre>\\n  <p>\\n    Now let's pass the source to the table instead of the data array:\\n  </p>\\n  <pre>\\n    <code class=\\\"typescript\\\">{{ snippets.sourceTemplate }}</code>\\n  </pre>\\n  <p>\\n    At this point if you look at the result there will be no difference comparing to the first example. Basically if you pass an array to the table component first thing it will do is wrap LocalDataSource object around your array as we did here manually.<br>\\n    Now, having the DataSource we basically could change the table data in any way we need to - filter it, sort, paginate to some page, create/delete/modify the rows. In our example we need to be able to filter the data outside of the table, firstly let's add a search filed to the template with a listener: \\n  </p>\\n  <pre>\\n    <code class=\\\"typescript\\\">{{ snippets.search }}</code>\\n  </pre>\\n  <p>\\n    And the listener code which asks the DataSource to filter the data:\\n  </p>\\n  <pre>\\n    <code class=\\\"typescript\\\">{{ snippets.searchTable }}</code>\\n  </pre>\\n  <p>\\n    Last thing, let's hide the default table filters to not conflict with our standalone one:\\n  </p>\\n  <pre>\\n    <code class=\\\"typescript\\\">{{ snippets.hideFilters }}</code>\\n  </pre>\\n  <p>\\n    And done! Now the table has a standalone search field:\\n  </p>\\n  <div>\\n    <basic-example-source></basic-example-source>\\n  </div>\\n  <p>\\n    Same way you can modify the data of the table, for example by adding a row from a third party form or listening to some external event.\\n    Here's a full component code:\\n  </p>\\n  <pre class=\\\"with-source\\\">\\n    <a class=\\\"source\\\"

The only <strong>required</strong> setting for the component to start working is a columns configuration.<br>\\n    Let's register <i>settings</i> property inside of the component where we want to have the table and configure some columns (<a [routerLink]=\\\"['/documentation']\\\">Settings documentation</a>):\\n  </p>\\n  <pre>\\n    <code class=\\\"typescript\\\">{{ snippets.settings }}</code>\\n  </pre>\\n  <p>\\n    Finally let's put the ng2-smart-table component inside of the template:\\n  </p>\\n  <pre>\\n    <code class=\\\"typescript\\\">{{ snippets.template }}</code>\\n  </pre>\\n  <p>\\n    At this step you will have a minimally configured table which should look something like this:\\n  </p>\\n  <div>\\n    <basic-example></basic-example>\\n  </div>\\n  <p>\\n    All functions are available by default and you don't need to configure them somehow, so you already able to add/edit/delete rows, sort or filter the table, etc.\\n  </p>\\n  <p>\\n    But it feels like something is missing... Right, there is no data in the table by default. To add some, let's create an array property with a list of objects in the component. Please note that object keys are same as in the columns configuration.\\n  </p>\\n  <pre>\\n    <code class=\\\"typescript\\\">{{ snippets.array }}</code>\\n  </pre>\\n  <p>And pass the data to the table:</p>\\n  <pre>\\n    <code class=\\\"typescript\\\">{{ snippets.dataTemplate }}</code>\\n  </pre>\\n  <p>Now you have some data in the table:</p>\\n  <div>\\n    <basic-example-data></basic-example-data>\\n  </div>\\n  <p>\\n    That's it for a minimal setup, our final component should look like this, pretty simple, huh?\\n  </p>\\n  <pre class=\\\"with-source\\\">\\n    <a class=\\\"source\\\" href=\\\"https://github.com/akveo/ng2-smart-table/blob/master/demo/src/app/pages/demo/components/basic-example-data.component.ts\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Demo Source</a>\\n    <code class=\\\"typescript\\\">{{ snippets.basicFull }}</code>\\n  </pre>\\n  <h3><a id=\\\"separate-filter\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\" href=\\\"#separate-filter\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"><span aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"octicon octicon-link\\\"></span></a>Standalone Filter Example</h3>\\n  <p>\\n    Say you don't need to have a filter field in the each table column or the requirements says that search field should be placed outside of the table?<br>\\n    Fortunately this is super easy to achieve, to do this we need to slightly modify our basic component example.\\n  </p>\\n  <h4><a id=\\\"data-source\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\" href=\\\"#data-source\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"><span aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"octicon octicon-link\\\"></span></a>Data Source</h4>\\n  <p>\\n    First thing you need to know is that all the data operations against the table <i>must</i> be done using the <strong>DataSource</strong> table property. DataSource is an abstraction around your data which allows you easily modify the table data or subscribe to events to modify the table behaviour. \\n  </p>\\n  <p>\\n    To access the DataSource we either can take it from the table or pass it instead of our <i>data array</i>. Let's do the second option as it requires less code and is more demonstrative. Let's import the DataSource class by modifying the import statement:\\n  </p>\\n  <pre>\\n    <code class=\\\"typescript\\\">{{ snippets.sourceRequire }}</code>\\n  </pre>\\n  <p>\\n    Note that the import now contains a <strong>LocalDataSource</strong> class (the word <i>Local</i> here means that the data is processed locally in a browser, not on the server side).<br>\\n    Then let's create a DataSource instance and pass our data array into it as a constructor parameter:\\n  </p>\\n  <pre>\\n    <code class=\\\"typescript\\\">{{ snippets.createSource }}</code>\\n  </pre>\\n  <p>\\n    Now let's pass the source to the table instead of the data array:\\n  </p>\\n  <pre>\\n    <code class=\\\"typescript\\\">{{ snippets.sourceTemplate }}</code>\\n  </pre>\\n  <p>\\n    At this point if you look at the result there will be no difference comparing to the first example. Basically if you pass an array to the table component first thing it will do is wrap LocalDataSource object around your array as we did here manually.<br>\\n    Now, having the DataSource we basically could change the table data in any way we need to - filter it, sort, paginate to some page, create/delete/modify the rows. In our example we need to be able to filter the data outside of the table, firstly let's add a search filed to the template with a listener: \\n  </p>\\n  <pre>\\n    <code class=\\\"typescript\\\">{{ snippets.search }}</code>\\n  </pre>\\n  <p>\\n    And the listener code which asks the DataSource to filter the data:\\n  </p>\\n  <pre>\\n    <code class=\\\"typescript\\\">{{ snippets.searchTable }}</code>\\n  </pre>\\n  <p>\\n    Last thing, let's hide the default table filters to not conflict with our standalone one:\\n  </p>\\n  <pre>\\n    <code class=\\\"typescript\\\">{{ snippets.hideFilters }}</code>\\n  </pre>\\n  <p>\\n    And done! Now the table has a standalone search field:\\n  </p>\\n  <div>\\n    <basic-example-source></basic-example-source>\\n  </div>\\n  <p>\\n    Same way you can modify the data of the table, for example by adding a row from a third party form or listening to some external event.\\n    Here's a full component code:\\n  </p>\\n  <pre class=\\\"with-source\\\">\\n    <a class=\\\"source\\\"

If the Observable\n * returned by `do` is not subscribed, the side effects specified by the\n * Observer will never happen. `do` therefore simply spies on existing\n * execution, it does not trigger an execution to happen like `subscribe` does.\n *\n * @example <caption>Map every every click to the clientX position of that click, while also logging the click event</caption>\n * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');\n * var positions = clicks\n *   .do(ev => console.log(ev))\n *   .map(ev => ev.clientX);\n * positions.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n *\n * @see {@link map}\n * @see {@link subscribe}\n *\n * @param {Observer|function} [nextOrObserver] A normal Observer object or a\n * callback for `next`.\n * @param {function} [error] Callback for errors in the source.\n * @param {function} [complete] Callback for the completion of the source.\n * @return {Observable} An Observable identical to the source, but runs the\n * specified Observer or callback(s) for each item.\n * @method do\n * @name do\n * @owner Observable\n */\nexport function _do<T>(nextOrObserver?: PartialObserver<T> | ((x: T) => void),\n                       error?: (e: any) => void,\n                       complete?: () => void): Observable<T> {\n  return this.lift(new DoOperator(nextOrObserver, error, complete));\n}\n\nexport interface DoSignature<T> {\n  (next: (x: T) => void, error?: (e: any) => void, complete?: () => void): Observable<T>;\n  (observer: PartialObserver<T>): Observable<T>;\n}\n\nclass DoOperator<T> implements Operator<T, T> {\n  constructor(private nextOrObserver?: PartialObserver<T> | ((x: T) => void),\n              private error?: (e: any) => void,\n              private complete?: () => void) {\n  }\n  call(subscriber: Subscriber<T>, source: any): any {\n    return source._subscribe(new DoSubscriber(subscriber, this.nextOrObserver, this.error, this.complete));\n  }\n}\n\n/**\n * We need this JSDoc comment for affecting ESDoc.\n * @ignore\n * @extends {Ignored}\n */\nclass DoSubscriber<T> extends Subscriber<T> {\n\n  private safeSubscriber: Subscriber<T>;\n\n  constructor(destination: Subscriber<T>,\n              nextOrObserver?: PartialObserver<T> | ((x: T) => void),\n              error?: (e: any) => void,\n              complete?: () => void) {\n    super(destination);\n\n    const safeSubscriber = new Subscriber<T>(nextOrObserver, error, complete);\n    safeSubscriber.syncErrorThrowable = true;\n    this.add(safeSubscriber);\n    this.safeSubscriber = safeSubscriber;\n  }\n\n  protected _next(value: T): void {\n    const { safeSubscriber } = this;\n    safeSubscriber.next(value);\n    if (safeSubscriber.syncErrorThrown) {\n      this.destination.error(safeSubscriber.syncErrorValue);\n    } else {\n      this.destination.next(value);\n    }\n  }\n\n  protected _error(err: any): void {\n    const { safeSubscriber } = this;\n    safeSubscriber.error(err);\n    if (safeSubscriber.syncErrorThrown) {\n      this.destination.error(safeSubscriber.syncErrorValue);\n    } else {\n      this.destination.error(err);\n    }\n  }\n\n  protected _complete(): void {\n    const { safeSubscriber } = this;\n    safeSubscriber.complete();\n    if (safeSubscriber.syncErrorThrown) {\n      this.destination.error(safeSubscriber.syncErrorValue);\n    } else {\n      this.destination.complete();\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./~/rxjs/src/operator/do.ts\n **/","import {Observable} from '../Observable';\nimport {Scheduler} from '../Scheduler';\nimport {Operator} from '../Operator';\nimport {Subscriber} from '../Subscriber';\nimport {tryCatch} from '../util/tryCatch';\nimport {errorObject} from '../util/errorObject';\nimport {Subscription} from '../Subscription';\nimport {OuterSubscriber} from '../OuterSubscriber';\nimport {InnerSubscriber} from '../InnerSubscriber';\nimport {subscribeToResult} from '../util/subscribeToResult';\n\n/**\n * Returns an Observable where for each item in the source Observable, the supplied function is applied to each item,\n * resulting in a new value to then be applied again with the function.\n * @param {function} project the function for projecting the next emitted item of the Observable.\n * @param {number} [concurrent] the max number of observables that can be created concurrently. defaults to infinity.\n * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler] The Scheduler to use for managing the expansions.\n * @return {Observable} an Observable containing the expansions of the source Observable.\n * @method expand\n * @owner Observable\n */\nexport function expand<T, R>(project: (value: T, index: number) => Observable<R>,\n                             concurrent: number = Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY,\n                             scheduler: Scheduler = undefined): Observable<R> {\n  concurrent = (concurrent || 0) < 1 ?
